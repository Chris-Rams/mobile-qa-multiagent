Mobile QA Multi-Agent Project

Welcome! This project is all about using a small team of AI helpers to test a mobile app automatically. You do not need to be a programmer to understand what this does. Here is the idea in plain language:

What it does:
This project creates a little but mighty “team” of computer help mates that can open a mobile app, follow some simple instructions, and then tell you if everything worked the way it should.

How it works in simple terms:
One helper decides what to do next, another helper does the tapping and swiping on the phone, and a third helper checks if the test passed or failed.

Why it’s useful:
It helps you test a mobile app without having to do everything by hand. Run the program, and it will do the testing for you.

And if the stars align:
If we’re lucky and the cosmos are on our side, we’ll be able to test multiple Android devices at the same time in the future. That’s the big goal at least!

I hope you find it easy to use and mhopefully it's not too glitchy.
